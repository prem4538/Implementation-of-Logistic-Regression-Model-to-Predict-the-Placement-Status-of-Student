# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### step 1
Import the standard libraries. 
### step 2 
Upload the dataset and check for any null or duplicated values using .isnull() and .duplicated() function respectively.
### step 3
Import LabelEncoder and encode the dataset. 
### step 4 
Import LogisticRegression from sklearn and apply the model on the dataset.
### step 5
Predict the values of array.
### step 6
Calculate the accuracy, confusion and classification report by importing the required modules from sklearn.
### step 7
Apply new unknown values

## Program:
